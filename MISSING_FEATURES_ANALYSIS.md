# üö® Updated Analysis: Realtime Feature Status

## Current Services

### ‚úÖ Service 1: Q&A + Resume API (Port 8084)

| Endpoint | Status |
|----------|--------|
| POST /api/ask | Implemented |
| POST/GET /api/resume | Implemented |
| GET /api/health | Implemented |
| User Authentication | Added |
| Usage Tracking | Added |

### üîÑ Service 2: Realtime Sessions API (Port 8080)

Core endpoints are implemented in `production_realtime.py`. The advanced
session manager in `app/realtime.py` remains experimental.

#### Endpoint Readiness

| Endpoint | Description | Readiness |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| GET /api/health | Service health | ‚úÖ Production |
| POST /api/sessions | Create session | ‚úÖ Production |
| GET /api/sessions/<id> | Retrieve session | ‚úÖ Production |
| DELETE /api/sessions/<id> | End session | ‚úÖ Production |
| POST /api/sessions/<id>/captions | Add caption and auto-generate answer | ‚úÖ Production |
| GET /api/sessions/<id>/answers | Fetch answers | ‚úÖ Production |
| GET /api/sessions/<id>/stream | Server-sent events stream | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental |
| GET /api/sessions/<id>/memory | Retrieve conversation memory | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental |
| POST /api/knowledge/search | Knowledge base search | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental |
| GET /api/knowledge/stats | Knowledge base stats | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental |
| POST /api/knowledge/add | Add document to knowledge base | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental |
| POST /api/meeting-events | Meeting lifecycle events | ‚ùå Missing |

#### Experimental Session Manager (`app/realtime.py`)

The `app/realtime.py` module prototypes advanced features such as speaker
diarization, question boundary detection, and memory-backed context. These
capabilities are not yet wired into the production service and should be
considered experimental.

## Remaining Work

- Implement meeting event ingestion and multi-client session sharing.
- Integrate diarization and memory services from `app/realtime.py`.
- Harden SSE streaming for production use.
- Persist and expose knowledge base features.

## Summary

The realtime service now covers basic session management and AI answering,
leaving advanced meeting intelligence and analytics for future iterations.
