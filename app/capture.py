"""Meeting capture module.

This module provides functions to connect to meeting platforms and capture
audio/video streams.  In a real implementation you might integrate with
Zoom/Teams/GoogleÂ Meet APIs or use a bot account that joins calls and
records them.  For now, the functions here are placeholders that simply
log their invocation.
