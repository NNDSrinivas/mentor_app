"""Knowledge base integration module.

This module defines a simple interface for storing and retrieving project
knowledge.  A real implementation might ingest source code, design
documents, tickets and wiki pages, compute embeddings using a model
like OpenAIâ€™s Ada embedding model or Hugging Face models, and store
them in a vector database (e.g., pgvector, Pinecone).  Queries would
retrieve relevant documents to provide context when answering questions.
