"""Summarization module.

This module defines functions to summarize transcribed text and answer
questions about meetings or tasks.  In a production system you would
connect to a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI's GPT‑4 or
Anthropic's Claude.  You may also combine it with retrieval‑augmented
generation (RAG) to pull information from your knowledge base.
