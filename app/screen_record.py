"""Screen recording module.

The functions in this module describe how you might record and analyze the
screen during meetings or coding sessions.  In practice, capturing the
screen may require a browser extension (for web meetings) or platform
specific APIs.  The analysis could involve optical character recognition
(OCR) to extract text or computer vision models to recognize UI elements
and diagrams.
