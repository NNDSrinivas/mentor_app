"""Topâ€‘level package for the AI Mentor Assistant prototype.

This package defines a set of modules that work together to capture meetings,
perform transcription and summarization, record the screen and interface with
a project knowledge base.  Each module currently contains placeholder
functions to illustrate the API surface.  As you develop the application,
replace these stubs with actual implementations.
