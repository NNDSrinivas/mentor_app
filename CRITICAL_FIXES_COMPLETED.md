## ðŸ“‹ Summary of Issues Fixed

The user reported 3 critical bugs during real-world testing of the AI Interview Assistant. All issues have been successfully diagnosed and fixed.

## âœ… Issue #1: AI Not Answering Properly (FIXED)

**Problem:** User reported "AI is not answering properly at all" and noted that the UI didn't have an option to upload resume.

**Root Cause:** The AI assistant lacked resume context for personalized responses, and there was no user-friendly way to upload resume data.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Added comprehensive resume upload functionality** to `simple_web_clean.py`:
  - Drag & drop file upload interface
  - Direct text paste capability
  - Support for PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT files (up to 16MB)
  - Real-time status tracking and feedback
  - Resume context integration with AI assistant

**Key Features Added:**
- File upload API endpoints (`POST /api/resume`, `GET /api/resume`, `DELETE /api/resume`)
- Helper functions for file processing and text extraction
- Enhanced web interface with upload area and status indicators
- Resume metadata tracking (word count, upload date)
- Integration with AI assistant for personalized responses

## âœ… Issue #2: Privacy Violation - AI Visible to Other Users (FIXED)

**Problem:** Critical security issue - when user opened Google Meet or Zoom meetings, the AI overlay/responses were visible to other meeting participants, violating privacy and professional confidentiality.

**Root Cause:** The browser extension was not properly implementing stealth mode by default, and screen sharing detection was not comprehensive enough.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Privacy-first architecture** - AI now starts in stealth mode by default
- **Enhanced screen sharing detection** with multiple detection methods:
  - API interception (getDisplayMedia, getUserMedia)
  - DOM mutation observers for platform-specific indicators
  - Continuous monitoring for Google Meet and Zoom UI changes
  - Page title and URL monitoring
  - Tab visibility change detection

**Key Changes to `browser_extension/content.js`:**
- Default stealth mode activation on initialization
- Aggressive overlay hiding (removed from DOM completely)
- Ultra-minimal stealth indicator (tiny green dot)
- Separate popup window for user interaction during stealth mode
- Enhanced screen sharing detection with fallback mechanisms
- Emergency hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+H) for manual toggle

**Privacy Features:**
- Overlay completely removed from DOM during stealth mode
- AI responses displayed in separate popup window invisible to screen sharing
- Automatic activation when screen sharing is detected
- Manual toggle available for emergency situations

## âœ… Issue #3: UI Not Displaying AI Answers (FIXED)

**Problem:** AI responses were being generated but not displayed properly in the browser extension overlay.

**Root Cause:** The `displayAnswer` function was trying to update DOM elements that were removed when stealth mode was activated by default.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Enhanced displayAnswer function** with intelligent routing:
  - Detects current mode (stealth vs normal)
  - Creates offscreen window automatically if needed
  - Fallback mechanisms for failed message passing
  - Robust error handling and recovery

**Key Improvements:**
- Smart display routing based on stealth mode status
- Automatic offscreen window creation when needed
- Enhanced error handling and retry mechanisms
- Consistent answer formatting across display modes
- Detailed logging for debugging

**Technical Details:**
- Fixed duplicate `displayAnswer` functions in content.js
- Added proper stealth mode detection
- Implemented failsafe mechanisms for offscreen communication
- Enhanced message passing between main tab and popup window
