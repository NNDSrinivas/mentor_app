#### 3. AUTOMATED DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW
**Current**: Basic code Q&A
**Needed**:
- [ ] IDE deep integration (file context, git status)
- [ ] Automated code generation from requirements
- [ ] Unit test generation
- [ ] Code review and PR automation
- [ ] Build monitoring and failure analysis
- [ ] Automated bug fixing

#### 4. COMPREHENSIVE MEMORY SYSTEM
**Current**: Basic session storage
**Needed**:
- [ ] Long-term user profile and preferences
- [ ] Project/team context persistence  
- [ ] Meeting history and cross-references
- [ ] Code pattern learning
- [ ] Decision history tracking

#### 5. PRIVACY & STEALTH FEATURES
**Current**: Basic overlay
**Needed**:
- [ ] Interview mode with invisible assistance
- [ ] Mobile-only private interface
- [ ] Encrypted data storage
- [ ] User permission controls
- [ ] Audit trail for compliance

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### Memory/Context System
- PostgreSQL for structured data (users, projects, tasks)
- Vector database (ChromaDB/Pinecone) for semantic search
- Redis for real-time session state
- Encrypted file storage for recordings

### AI/ML Pipeline
- OpenAI GPT-4 for reasoning and generation
- Whisper for transcription
- Custom fine-tuned models for code generation
- Speaker diarization models (pyannote.audio)

### Integration Strategy
- REST APIs for external tool integration
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- File system watchers for IDE integration
- Screen capture for meeting recording

### Privacy & Security
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Local processing for critical operations
- User consent flows for all data collection
- Audit logging for compliance

## MONETIZATION STRATEGY

### Pricing Tiers
1. **Individual** ($29/month): Core features, limited integrations
2. **Professional** ($79/month): Full features, unlimited integrations  
3. **Team** ($149/month/5 users): Collaboration features, admin controls
4. **Enterprise** (Custom): SSO, compliance, dedicated support

### Revenue Streams
- SaaS subscriptions
- API usage fees for integrations
- Premium AI model access
- Custom enterprise deployments
